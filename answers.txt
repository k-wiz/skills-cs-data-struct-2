RECURSION
1. Recursion is invoking a function call on itself. 
2. A base case is the condition on which the function stops making recursive calls and returns something. Without a base case, a recursive function call goes on indefinitely and eventually times out. 

GRAPHS
1. A graph represents relationships between things and is made of a collection of nodes connected by edges.  A tree is just a restricted form of a graph. 
2. Unlike trees, nodes in a graph can have multiple parents, graphs can contain loops, and relationships can be non-directed. 
3. Relationships between people.

GIT BRANCHING 
1. Testing a new feature that I'm not sure I want to incorporate; 
working with multiple team members on same project
2. A pull request ia a request for the project owner to review and merge code
with the main branch.
