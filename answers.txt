RECURSION
1. Recursion is invoking a function call on itself. 
2. A base case is the condition on which the function stops making recursive calls and returns something. Without a base case, a recursive function call goes on indefinitely and eventually times out. 

GRAPHS
1. A graph represents relationships between things and is made of a collection of nodes connected by edges.  A tree is just a restricted form of a graph. 
2. Unlike trees, nodes in a graph can have multiple parents, graphs can contain loops, and relationships can be non-directed. 
3. Relationships between people.

SORTING
1. Bubble Sort algorithm -- compares each item in the list with the next item 
in the list. If the first item is larger than the second, the two items are 
swapped. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. 
2. Merge Sort algorithm -- Splits a list into several lists of one item each. 
Then, compares first item in 2 lists. Adds the smaller item to a resulting sorted list. 
Repeats comparison process until the sorted list is complete.
3. Quick sort algorithm -- picks a random pivot. Moves numbers that are lower 
than the pivot to the left of the number, and numbers that are higher than
the pivot to the right of the number. Repeats 


GIT BRANCHING 
1. Testing a new feature that I'm not sure I want to incorporate; 
working with multiple team members on same project
2. A pull request ia a request for the project owner to review and merge code
with the main branch.
